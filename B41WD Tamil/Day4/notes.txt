hoisting and scope
introductions to functions

hoisting:=> gives undefined
in other words, a variable can be used before it has been declared 
pushing the variable to the top of the scope.
hoisting occurs only in var keyword.
only var is hoisted, bcoz at the time only var is available.
var is global and functional scope.
var is the oldest keyword in javascript.

what is undefined?=> we are trying to access a variable without intialization.

ES5 => var=> redeclare an reassign
ES6 => let and const

comment=> ctrl+/=> shortcut
// => inside script

Introduction to functions:

set of instructions to perform a specific tasks.
code reusability=> functions

how to create a function:

every function should begin with the keywrod function
function name should be unique.
if we are not using return Keyword , it gives undefined
a list of parameters should be inside the (parameters) seperated by commas.
{} list of statement composing the body of the function
we should call the function at the end. 
functionname(arguments)
function always has a return keyword inside the paranthesis.
return keyword will stop the function once executed.

types of function:

1. named or normal function => 
syntax: function functionname(parameters){statement or condition return keyword}(arguments)

2. anonymous function=> fucntion has no name
syntax: variable variablename = function (){return}

3. IIFE (immediately invoked function expression)=>rarely used, less memory used
syntax: (function(){})();

4. Arrow function=> mostly used, latest version in ES6
syntax: variable varibalename = () => {}();
