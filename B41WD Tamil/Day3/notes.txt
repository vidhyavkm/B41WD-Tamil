copy/call by value and call/copy by reference 
window and document object 
Array and JSON iteration

call/copy by value:
primitive datatypes=> number, string , boolean
 a = 5
 b = a
a=b=5
this approach is called call by value where 2 variables become the same by copying the value,
but in 2 seperate spots in the memory.

copy by reference:
composite datatypes=> arrays and objects
arr = []

copy by value:
=> the original variable is not modified on changes in other variables.
=> actual and copied variables will be created in different memory locations
=> it takes high memory

copy by reference:
=> the original variable is gets modified on changes in other variables.
=> actual and copied variables will be created in same memory locations
=> it takes less memory.

Document and window object :
document is represent a web page that is loaded in the browser.
by accesing the document object , we can access the element in the html page .
with the help of document, we can add dynamic content to our webpage
document.propertyname => title, head, body, url
document.methodname => addeventlistenr(), create attributes()

window=> propertyname=> innerheight, innerwidth
methodname=> close(), alert(), open()

JSON:
javascript JSON=> javascript object notation {} ""
which is lightweight, and txt based designed, it has key valuepairs
and curly braces holds the object, the comma is used to seperate 
key value pairs, square brackest are used to hold arrays, where each vakue is coma seperated.
it is an open standard, data-intechange format.
it is lightweight and self describing
it is originated from javascript
it is easy to learn and write.
it is language dependent. 
it supports data structures such a arrays and objects.

JSON.parse():=> to convert the string into a JS object .
this method takes Json string and transforms it int0 a javscript object.
when we receiving data from server it is int he form of string
parse the data =by using JSON.parse

JSON.stringify()=> data to string
the method converts a js value to a json string represnetation
when sending data to the server the data should be in strign format .

array iteration:
for loop:
used to print the values of an array in order.
