datatypes:
1. Primitive => number, string, boolean
2. Composite 
3. Trivial datatypes

number=> ex: 2,3.5,100,  1/2
string => "guvi", 'geek'(single or double quotes)
Boolean=> true or false (1 or 0)

composite datatypes:
1. arrays 
2. objects

arrays
=> group of elements
=> collection of heterogeneous datatypes
=> represent : [] , seperated by commas
=> sequential chunk of memory
=> also refered as an object
=> starts with index 0 and ends with length-1(n-1)(memory location) 

["1", 23, "hello", "true", true] // length array=5

object;
always has a key and value as a pair.
represent as {}, seperated by commas
2ways can access the values=> dot opertor, sqaure brackets
object always returns the output in console in a alphabet order

window and object 
what is a window?
window is a browser page where we can see all the outputs directly and 
it has console, network windw everythong inside it .

trivial datatypes:

undefined => var , hoisting if we didnt assign the value
not defined=> we wont declare the value=>error
null => if there is no value and no variable name
