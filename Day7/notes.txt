Array Methods:

map, reduce , filter
heterogenous
[]
[1,"string",true]
index starts from 0.
length= n-1
elements, index
[1,2,3,4,56,6]

Map:
Transforms the Array
works on each and every element in an array.
returns a new array.
functions as a parameter.
it does not change the length of the array.
we cant use map if we want to change one particular element in an array.

array.map()=>ES6

for loop => ES5
var arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
[2,4,6,8,10]

syntax:

arr.map((element)=>{
    block of code
})

filter:

works on each and every element in an array.
returns the same array with same elements with different length.
functions as a parameter.
it does change the length of the array.
it always returns a array.
elimiante something as per the condition.

arr.filter((element)=>{
    block of code
})

Reduce:

works on each and every element in an array.
functions as a parameter.
it does change the length of the array.
it doesnt returns an array it always returns a single value
it has 2 parameters(accumulator and curr value)
if we are not giving acc value it takes 0 index at acc.

when we are using array of objects, always declare a acc value 
to avoid mistakes.
